Comments were saved in the bottom left of each slide, and references for this webpage are in its Appendix.\n\n\nCodespaces\nIn this workshop you will need to access the R code we have prepared for the worked through example and challenge questions. If you have not already, you will need to download R to your local device, and we suggest using the integrated development environment (IDE) software RStudio. Accessing the code for this workshop requires that you have git installed on your local device, a GitHub account, and you have configured the two. If you have not done this, go through Accounts and Configurations first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\n\nThis workshop was generated using R (v 4.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v 2024.12.1+563). renv() is included to reproduce the same coding enviroment, storing all the relevant packages and package versions needed in the code. If you experience trouble running the scripts, you might want to check that the environment was initialized and that you are using the same version of R and RStudio.\n\n\n\nTwo GitHub repositories have been created to practice using git and GitHub:\n\nSolo projects: ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Vaccinations\nGroup projects: ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths\n\nIn order to practice your skills with git and GitHub using our codespaces, you will need to create a “clean-break” copy of both repositories. This will fully decouple the codespace connections from the ysph-dsde GitHub accout, and allow you full access to its contents. There are two methods to do this: by the “GitHub Importer” tool or your command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows).\nBelow we have detailed how you can create a “clean-break” by both methods. We suggest you attempt the “GitHub Importer” tool option first, and if that fails to follow the command-line steps. Please note that the importer tool will sometimes take a few minutes to fully transfer over the files.\n\n\nMaking a Clean-Break Copy\n\nMETHOD 1: Copying Using GitHub Importer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis method is not a Fork. You can learn more about GitHub Importer here.\n\n\n\nLog in to your personal GitHub account.\nIn the top-right of the page navigation bar, select the   dropdown menu and click  Import repository.\nFill out the following sections:\n\nYour source repository details: Paste the https url of the repositories listed above. No credentials are required for this action.\nYour new repository details: Adjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository. It is good practice to initially set the repository to “Private”.\n\nClick the Begin import button to copy the codespace.\nAfter a few minutes, the newly created GitHub repository webpage will open up.\n\nIf this method is successful, then proceed to the Cloning the Copied Repository section. If this is not successful, you can try using the command-line application menthod detailed in Method 2.\n\n\nMETHOD 2: Copying Using The Command-Line Application\nThese directions follow GitHub’s duplicating a repository page.\n\nLog in to your personal GitHub account.\nNavigate to the ysph-dsde GitHub repository you want to copy by either searching for it by name or opening the url provided above.\nNear the right side of the page there will be a   Begin import  button to click. In its drop down menu under the “Local” tab you will see options to copy the SSH key or HTTPS url to the repository.\nFor example, if the repository name is “ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY” they will look like:\n# SSH\ngit@github.com:ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git\n# HTTPS\nhttps://github.com/ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git\nDepending on your Git/GitHub configurations, you will copy one of these for the remainder of the steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nSSH keys or HTTPS urls are file transfer protocols that are used to pass information between your local git configured directory to the remote GitHub repository. Only one protocol can be set up for one Git/GitHub connection.\n\n\n\nOpen the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) and navigate to the file location you want to temporarily store the repository copy.\ncd \"/file_location/\"\nClone a bare copy of the original repository using its SSH key or HTTPS url:\n # SSH\n git clone --bare git@github.com:ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git\n# HTTPS\ngit clone --bare https://github.com/ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git\nOpen the project file.\ncd \"ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git\"\nBack in GitHub, in the top-right of the page navigation bar select the   dropdown menu and click  New repository.\nFill out the following sections:\n\nAdjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository.\nIt is good practice to initially set the repository to “Private”.\nDo NOT use a template or include a description, README.md, .gitignore, or license.\n\nIn the newly created GitHub repository under “Quick setup” you will find the repository’s SSH key or HTTPS url. Copy this.\nBack in the command-line application, push a mirror of the cloned git file to your newly created GitHub repository using its SSH key or HTPPS url:\n# SSH\ngit push --mirror git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\n# HTTPS\ngit push --mirror https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\nRefresh the new GitHub reposiotry webpage to confirm the push was successful.\nDelete the bare cloned file used to create a new remote repository.\ncd ..                                   # Go back one file location\nrm -rf ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git          # Delete the bare clone\nThis completes creating a clean-break copy of the ysph-dsde repository codespace. Proceed with cloning the newly made repository to your local device in the following section.\n\n\n\n\nCloning the Copied Repository\nNow that you have copied this repository into your own GitHub, you are ready to proceed with a standard clone to your local device.\n\nCopy the SSH key or HTTPS url to the newly created repository in your GitHub account by finding the codes under the   Begin import  button.\n# SSH\ngit@github.com:ysph-dsde/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\n# HTTPS\nhttps://github.com/ysph-dsde/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\nIn the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) navigate to the file location you want to store the repository.\ncd \"/file_location/\"\nClone the the repository.\n# using SSH\ngit clone git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\n\n# or using HTTPS\ngit clone https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git\nOPTIONAL: You can reset the repository history, which will clear the previous commits, by running the following block of code (Source: StackExchange by Zeelot).\ngit checkout --orphan tempBranch         # Create a temporary branch\ngit add -A                               # Add all files and commit them\ngit commit -m \"Reset the repo\"\ngit branch -D main                       # Deletes the main branch\ngit branch -m main                       # Rename the current branch to main\ngit push -f origin main                  # Force push main branch to GitHub\ngit gc --aggressive --prune=all          # Remove the old files\n\n\n\nInitializing the Environment\nAfter cloning the codespace to your local device, you will need to initialize the environment using renv(). This will install all packages and versions used in the workshop, thus creating a reproducible coding environemnt.\n\nIn the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) navigate to the file location you want to store the repository.\ncd \"/file_location/\"\nLaunch the project by opening the *.Rproj in RStudio.\nIn the R console, activate the enviroment by runing the following lines of code:\nrenv::init()          # initialize the project\nrenv::restore()       # download packages and their version saved in the lockfile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you are asked to update packages, say no. The renv() is intended to recreate the same environment under which the project was created, making it reproducible. You are ready to proceed when running renv::restore() gives the output:\n- The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.\nIf you experience any trouble with this step, you might want to confirm that you are using R (v 4.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v 2024.12.1+563).

Parquet is a column-oriented data file that allows for efficient data storage and lightweight information retrieval. It is best suited for large data sets that cannot be easily handled “in-memory”. Using the arrow package, we can read and manipulate files in this form.\nThose interested to learn more about how they can use parquet to efficiently process large datasets are encouraged to review the workshops hosted by one of our guest speakers, Professor Thomas Lumley: Thomas Lumley Workshops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion - geolocation at the state and 10 Health and Human Services Regions (HHS) level.\nSeason - the infection season of the observation, defined to span from July to June of the following year.\nWeek Observed - the week when the record was added, in Date format.\nMMWRyear, MMWRweek, MMWRday - the year, week, and day of the entry in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) format. MMWR is the standard epidemiological week assigned by National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) in their disease reports (MMWR Definition).\nCharacteristic and Level - the type of additional stratification and the group represented, respectively. i.e. “Characteristic = Sex; Level = Female”.\nPositives Detected - the number of lab-confirmed RSV hospitalizations detected.\nScaled Detected - the relative scale of RSV infections detected for inter-season comparison, controlling for each stratification.

    "text": "4.2 Basic Uses of ggplot2()\n\n\n\n\nFigure from “ggplot2 workshop part 1” by Thomas LinPedersen. Accessed from YouTube March 15th, 2025.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 The Data and Mapping Layers\nThe first (and arguably most crucial!) layer is Data, but simply adding it to ggplot() will only generate a plot object with nothing else. In the second layer, Mapping, we tell the function which variables get used for which aesthetic feature displayable on the plot object.\nIn this layer, we define the position, color, size, or shape that our values take. Every type of data representation requires an aesthetic statement to point variables to relevant aesthetic features. This can help make a plot visually appealing, but an astute user of ggplot() will leverage them to highlight underlying patterns in the data as well.\nHere we use the mapping function, aes(), to point the week in the epidemiological year (MMWR) variable to the x-axis and RSV positive tests (scaled and Gaussian kernel smoothed) to the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry and Statistic Layers Dictate the Aesthetics Mapping\n\n\n\nAs we will see in the next two layers, the kinds of features that are required to generate the most fundamental visualization of our data will depend on the type of geometry or statistical transformation we are plotting. Data and Mapping must always be defined by the user. Some geom_*() or stat_*() functions also require the plot-specific statistic or position to be provided by the user, but sometimes these elements are already assigned by the default settings.\nYou can find more about the required and ancillary aesthetic features used by different Geometry or Statistics layers in the ggplot2 package references documentation and cheatsheet. Different specifications available for aesthetic features can also be found in one of their vignettes: aesthetic specifications.\n\n\n\n# The data and aesthetics mapping layers combined.\nggplot(data = df, aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe can use the base R pipe symbol |&gt; to pass objects into subsequent functions that build on the previous result. This has the added benefit of organizing operations into digestible pieces, as opposed to gnarly nested functions. That would not be so knarly, man!\nGoing forward we will no longer explicitly dictate that data = df, as this is already implied by the pipe operation. Just keep in mind that the start of a graphical expression begins with a ggplot() + statement, and everything preceding this is not part of the graphical layers.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 The Geometry Layer\nWe will now tell the function how we want the data to be displayed in the plot object. We do this by adding the Geometry layer. Together with Data and Mapping, these three layers form the core pieces required to generate any basic visualization with ggplot2.\nThe Geometry layer does the computational legwork that translate a data frame with mappings into a discernible plot. Behind the scenes, it is computing how points get spaced and oriented to create the specific geometry defined, whether that be for a histogram, scatter plot, box plot, and so forth.\nEach geometry layer can take a specific data and aesthetics mapping, overwriting anything defined in the ggplot() plot object. It also interprets a statistical transformation and position adjustment to modulate the graph. Here, we will plot a trend line showing changes in RSV positives detected over the course of an infection season by using geom_line().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn some ggplot2 references statistics and position are both defined as separate layers in the hierarchy. This workshop separates out statistics, but does not separate out position its own layer.\nPosition sets the rules around how objects get placed relative to one another; a setting necessary within some geom_* functions. Think of plotting a histogram scaled with an aesthetic color mapping. Do the groupings plot on top of each other, side-by-side, or get scaled to fill [0, 1] on the y-axis? This is what the position setting will determine.\n\n\n\n# All three required layers combined: data, aesthetics mapping, and geometry.\ndf |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_line(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at this plot, I mean oy vey! If we think back to the glimpse of our dataset we might remember that there are additional columns of information that we can use to further distinguish one infections trend.\n\n\n$Region\n [1] \"California\"     \"Colorado\"       \"Connecticut\"    \"Georgia\"       \n [5] \"Maryland\"       \"Michigan\"       \"Minnesota\"      \"New Mexico\"    \n [9] \"New York\"       \"North Carolina\" \"Oregon\"         \"Region 1\"      \n[13] \"Region 10\"      \"Region 2\"       \"Region 3\"       \"Region 4\"      \n[17] \"Region 5\"       \"Region 6\"       \"Region 8\"       \"Region 9\"      \n[21] \"Tennessee\"      \"Utah\"          \n\n$Season\n[1] \"2016-17\" \"2017-18\" \"2018-19\" \"2019-20\" \"2020-21\" \"2021-22\" \"2022-23\"\n[8] \"2023-24\" \"2024-25\"\n\n$`Characteristic Level`\n [1] \"1-4 Years\"                        \"18-49 Years\"                     \n [3] \"5-17 Years\"                       \"50-64 Years\"                     \n [5] \"65-74 Years\"                      \"75+ Years\"                       \n [7] \"&lt;1 Years\"                         \"American Indian or Alaska Native\"\n [9] \"Asian or Pacific Islander\"        \"Black or African American\"       \n[11] \"Female\"                           \"Hispanic or Latino\"              \n[13] \"Male\"                             \"N/A\"                             \n[15] \"White\"                           \n\n\n\ndf |&gt;\n  # Subset the data to one infection trend outcome by selecting one possible\n  # instantiation from the array of distinguishing variables.\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season == \"2021-22\", Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    geom_line(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks much nicer, but it doesn’t tell us much about our data. Notice, however, that the same plot can be generated by adding the aesthetics mapping to the plot object (ggplot()) or the geom_*() layer.\n\n# A viable alternative representation of the above code:\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season == \"2021-22\", Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel)) +\n    geom_line()\n\nDiscussion: Can you think of reasons why you would choose one over the other?\nYou might be asking yourself why I went through the pains of showing the thought process behind tuning the plot so that it shows one distinguishable trend line. Am I not simply covering the grammar of whatever to plot a simple trend line while you eat a delicious cookie and compartmentalize your upcoming exams?\nAs I hinted at earlier, the advanced user of ggplot2 is going to leverage these layers for effective visualization of underlying patterns of the data itself. By controlling for variables that add noise or redundancies to a plot, we are opening the door for inspiring communicating insights through visualization.\nRecall:\n\n“… graphics are instruments of reasoning about quantitative information” – Yale Professor Edward Tufte from his book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\n\nMore on this in a moment. But while I have your attention, those cookies are delicious; this is objectively and observably true.\n\n\n4.2.3 The Statistics Layer\nFollowing the Geometries layer in our hierarchy is Statistics. In this context, statistics refers to the transformations applied to data primarily for the purposes of generating plottable values. For example, calculating box plot quartiles or bar plot counts.\nThese same transformations are being used under the hood of the geome_*() functions. As you might expect, many statistics functions are interchangeable with geometric functions. For example, one can use geom_bar(stat = \"count\") or stat_count(geom = \"bar\") to produce the same bar plot (ggplot2 Layer statistical transformations - Paired geoms and stats).\nKeep in mind, however, that this is not always true, and sometimes statistical functions are sub-components of composite geometric engines. One example being the stat_ydensity() function, which generates the smoothed lines along the y-axis of a violin plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you want to use a statistically transformed variable for an aesthetic like fill or color, you need to use after_stat() around the variable name to scale the mapped aesthetic properly. An example provided in the ggplot2 cheatsheet is: ggplot(df) + stat_density_2d(aes(fill = after_stat(level)), geom = \"polygon\").\n\n\nIn our example I had separately smoothed the “Scaled Positives” variable using a spline or Gaussian kernel. If I plot a ggplot2 statistic layer that smooths the same variable using the locally estimated scatter plot smoothing (LOESS) method we see it aligns closely with the Gaussian kernel result.\n\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season == \"2021-22\", Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  ggplot() +\n    # Values smoothed before plotting using Gaussian kernel.\n    # Plotted as the black line.\n    geom_line(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel)) +\n    # Values smoothed by the stat_smooth() ggplot function using LOESS.\n    # Plotted as the blue line.\n    stat_smooth(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = `Scaled Positives`),\n                geom = \"smooth\", method = \"loess\",\n                se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nWhen a stat_*() is applied to a data frame (either inside a Geometric or Statistic layer), a modified data frame is generated as the output containing new, transformed variables. It is possible to call these “generated variables” within the plot object and use them for graph tuning.\nOne example provided in ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, shows how to call the stat_density() “generated variable”, density, created when the data frame is passed through geom_histogram(): Chapter 13 Generated variables.\n\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 500) plots a histogram with counts as the y-axis.\nggplot(df, aes(x)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)), binwidth = 500) plots that same histogram with the calculated distribution density as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.4 The Scales Layer\nIn the same way the Statistics layer defines the statistical transformations happening under the hood of the geometric functions, Scales is what interprets an aesthetic Mapping into plottable values. Once the aesthetics are defined by the user, the ggplot2 algorithm automatically applies the necessary scales. Unless we want to customize the scaling, the user does not need to explicitly write out the default scales needed to generate a plot.\nFor example, scale_*_continuous() gets automatically applied to our plot because of the x and y aesthetics mappings we’ve defined. The code snippet below explicitly writes out these scaling functions that get used, but because we are not modifying their defaults it is not necessary to include them in our own code.\n\n# The automatically applied scale_*() functions to the x and y mapping.\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season == \"2021-22\", Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    # The following two lines are not required for us to include since\n    # they are implied by the type of x and y vectors we assigned.\n    scale_x_continuous() +\n    scale_y_continuous()\n\nOne of the greatest advantages to ggplot2 is it offers users a great deal of flexibility. This concept is especially true for the Scales layer. While the preceding layers offer some level of customization, the Scales layer increases the available options by adding on top of previous settings. This cross-layer communication makes for a seemingly endless array of options and can make it one of the hardest layers to master.\nMost customization options fall into two buckets:\n\nPosition scales and axes (Chapter 10 of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis)\nColor scales and legends (Chapter 11 of the same book)\n\nThe different applications of Scales covered in these chapters range from canonical axes scaling using scale_*_log10(), scale_*_sqrt(), and scale_*_reverse() to tuning axis breaks and labeling or from scaling color pallets to cleaning the legend. The two chapters I’ve cited here from ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro and Thomas Lin Pedersen are invaluable introductions to different applications of Scales.\nIn the Scales layer of our example, we will use labs() to customize the plot labels and set the y-axis limits to span the entire range of our variable, [0, 100]. It is also possible to assign customized color pallets to grouped outcomes. Say that for our example we want to compare RSV infection trends between seasons going back three years to 2022, including the current infections season. How do we modify our running plot example to do this?\nSteps:\n\nAdd an aesthetic Mapping that prompts the plot object to group the unique seasons represented and associate them with a color.\nAdd a scale_color_* function that will apply a customized color to the Scales layer instead of the default palette.\n\n\n# Specify the infection seasons we'd like to see out of the range of options.\ninclude_seasons &lt;- c(\"2022-23\", \"2023-24\", \"2024-25\")\n\n# Using Scales to highlight insights to infection trends across seasons.\nplot_A &lt;- df |&gt;\n  # Since we are grouping outcomes by Season, we only need to subset the\n  # dataset to the three seasons we wish to plot.\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  # Add the aesthetic mapping that will color (and group) outcomes based\n  # on the unique elements in the Season variable. Also set the y-axis range\n  # and customize plot labels.\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() + \n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100)\n    # Notice that we do not need to specify a scale_color_*() because\n    # we want this plot to use the default color palette.\n\n\n# Customizing the color applied to that grouping by building on the first plot.\nplot_B &lt;- plot_A +\n    # \"Type\" denotes which set of color palette's to choose from. In\n    # this case we are choosing from the \"Type = Qualitative\", from\n    # which we can choose the \"Palette = Dark2\".\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion: We see that associating a variable with an aes(color) will also group by that same variable.\n\nWhat would happen if we only group the outcomes and exclude the color statement: i.e. aes(group = Season)?\nDoes adding a scale_color_*() statement change the result?\nWhy do you see the result you get?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nScales allows you to modify the limits of axes (i.e. with lims() or *lim()) giving the illusion that you can “zoom” into the plot. This is not a good use of the Scales layer, as it will sometimes have the unintended effect of distorting your result. Instead use the Coordinates layer to zoom into a select portion of your plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nggplot2 does not give users a way to combine multiple plots together into one composite figure that is publication-ready. Fortunately, the community developed ggplot2 extension, cowplot, was created specifically to support generating publication-quality figures. This is the package extension I used to generate plots A and B in the recent example!\ncowplot pkgdown page developed by Professor Claus Wilke at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 The Facets Layer\nIn the recent section, we showed how we can use Scales to highlight differences in infection trends between seasons. Doing so will plot the results on the same object, but what if we want to separate group comparisons over multiple plots?\nTechnically, we could code a new plot for each discrete subgrouping of our data that we want to spread out. If each plot is comprised of the same elements and aesthetic settings, however, there is an easier way to achieve the same result. The Facets layer allows us to generate a matrix grid showing the exact same plot for each subgroup available in a discrete variable.\nSimilar to the Scales layer, each plot object we compose implicitly assigns the faceting to NULL by default. The user only needs to include a Facets layer expression if they wish to change the default settings.\n\n# The default faceting is automatically applied.\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level == \"N/A\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100) +\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    # The following line not required for us to include.\n    facet_null()\n\nThere are two functions for faceting: facet_grid() and facet_wrap(). Both functions receive similar arguments expressed slightly differently, and thus ultimately do the same thing. The biggest difference between them is facet_grid() will divide categories into new columns or rows, while facet_wrap() will optimize the matrix output into a roughly rectangular view.\nIt is best practice to choose the right faceting function based on how long the array of discrete outcomes you will be showing is. In our case, we are going to further resolve comparisons of RSV infections by seasons to include an additional comparison between a selection of age groups. The dataset includes seven age groups, but we are primarily interested in comparing infection trends in children, adults, and the elderly. We will therefore, only be plotting three different groups, making facet_grid() and acceptable function to use.\nfacet_grid() allows us to specify how the subplots are organized: by new columns or new rows. It is possible to compare as many as two variables by separating one over new columns and another over new rows: facet_grid(rows ~ columns). We will separate out the age groups over new columns by dictating facet_grid(~Level). Notice that we want to specify the order we see these panels, which we can do by wrapping our variable name with factor(Level, levels = ordered_vector).\n\n# Create our ordered vector that will be used in factor().\nages_ordered &lt;- c(\"5-17 Years\", \"18-49 Years\", \"75+ Years\")\n\n# Add column-wise faceting.\ndf |&gt;\n  # We only want to maintain three of the seven age groups recorded. We can\n  # use the same variable we generate above to select these.\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level %in% ages_ordered) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100) +\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    # Use \"~Level\" instead of \"Level~\" to create new plots as columns.\n    facet_grid(~factor(Level, levels = ages_ordered))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.6 The Coordinates Layer\nUp until this point, we have covered layers that attribute variables to geometric-specific aesthetics in Mappings and transformations that interpret those assignments into plottable values in Statistics and Scales. The Geometry layer does a combination of statistical transformations and positioning, preparing the attributed variables into values that will take the chart shape we are looking to create.\nIt is the Coordinates layer that then plots these values on a graph. It’s important to appreciate this subtlety because some scaled or statistically transformed values will look entirely different if the wrong coordinate system is applied. Such as, if we attempted to plot an angle on a Cartesian plane in Euclidean space instead of in polar coordinates.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5 from “Data Visualization: From Theory to Practice” by James Baglin. Accessed March 22nd, 2025.\n\n\nCoordinate layer functions fall into two buckets:\n\nLinear: coord_cartesian(), coord_flip(), and coord_fixed()\nNon-linear: coord_map()/coord_quickmap()/coord_sf(), coord_polar(), and coord_trans()\n\nApplying the Cartesian, polar, and transformed coordinates is reasonably straightforward, and we will introduce the topic of map projections today. Keep in mind that the Coordinate layer plays an abstract role in the plot composite making for some key application notes that the user will need to be aware of. More on this subject can be explored in Chapter 15 Coordinate systems of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.\nPreviously, we mentioned that axis limits can be applied in Scales, but by doing so we unintentionally skew the results. Instead, it is better to “zoom” into a plot using the Coordinates layer. In a similar vein, if we want to swap the axes our x and y variables get plotted to, we want to use coord_flip() instead of changing aes(x = x_var, y = y_var) to aes(x = y_var, y = x_var).\n\n# By default, plots are generated on non-transformed Cartesian coordinates.\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level %in% ages_ordered) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100) +\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    facet_grid(~factor(Level, levels = ages_ordered)) +\n    # The following line not required for us to include.\n    coord_cartesian()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nAs with any grammar, there are different ways we can make a statement. Say we have a variable that plots with a curve, and you know that you can linearize it using a base 10 \\log. We now have three approaches to graphically representing its linearized transformation. This example is from the coord_trans() documentation, Transformed Cartesian coordinate system.\n\nTransform before plotting or in aes() with log10(). NOTE: only do simple transformations in aes(), like a \\log_{10} transformation, and leave more complicated operations to more robust methods.\nScales: scale_*_log10() or scale_*_continuous(trans = \"log10\")\nCoordinates: coord_trans(* = \"log10\")\n\nDiscussion: If we apply each option individually, do they all plot the same way? If not, what do you think is happening and how would you fix the code?\n\n\n\n\n4.2.7 The Theme Layer\nThe Theme layer gives the users control over non-data aspects of the plot: i.e. styling the fonts, axes ticks, panel strips, backgrounds, location (or the exclusion) of the legend, etc. It is used to format the plot, making it visually appealing or match intended design schemes. Unlike every other layer described, Theme will not change how values are transformed, their perceptual properties, or how geometries get rendered.\nHow the user intends to use Themes will depend on where in the data processing cycle they are performing visualization, and how they want their polished plots to look. It is therefore not likely to be helpful if I get granular about the different function arguments in Themes. Instead, I encourage students to explore the layer reference page, where they can peruse details for all the possible function arguments at their leisure: Modify components of a theme.\nggplot2 comes with numerous theme that get installed with the package: Complete themes. There are also numerous community developed themes that you can load, some of which have been curated by R Charts: Themes in ggplot2.\nEach time you make a plot, the default is theme_gray(). As before, you do not need to explicitly write this out if you do not intend to change the default settings. In our example, we want use another, more visually appealing theme that better displays our results. We will use another ggplot provided theme: theme_linedraw().\n\n# Using one of ggplot2's provided theme presets.\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level %in% ages_ordered) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() +\n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100) +\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    facet_grid(~factor(Level, levels = ages_ordered)) + \n    # Add the Themes layer at the end of our plot object expression.\n    theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nSay you regularly generate plots that you want to apply the same custom Theme settings to, such as producing visualizations for a group that has specific branding or plots for a cohesive publication. There are two possible solutions you can take that will obviate the need to rewrite the same theme settings in each plot object.\n\ntheme_set() allows you to set a new theme globally, overriding the default theme settings for the environment: Get, set, and modify the active theme.\nCreating your own custom theme function by modify an existing theme_*() or writing one from scratch: Learning to create custom themes in ggplot by Maddie Pickens and Chapter 20.1 New Themes of ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.8 Overlaying Layers\nNow that we have become acclimated to each layer that constitutes one cohesive graph, we are ready to discuss how to effectively build more complex graphs by overlaying additional layers. Earlier I hinted that the expressions for each layer stands alone as its own object in the programming environment. When a graph is rendered by ggplot2 its going to compress these layers one on top of another sequentially.\nThis is all well and good if the plots we are generating contain the same Data and Mapping settings, but what if they do not? What if we want to plot a new Geometry or Statistic layer that doesn’t use the same settings used by other layers? Every time you add a new layer, you have the opportunity to override the inherited settings that were given in the leading plot object, ggplot().\nFor example, consider the following code. What happens if we change aspects of the Data and Mapping used by geom_line()?\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel)) + \n  geom_line()\n\n\nOverriding ggplot()table from 13.4 Aesthetic mappings in ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.\n\n\nOperation\nLayer aesthetics\nResult\n\n\n\n\nAdd\naes(colour = Season)\naes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, colour = Season)\n\n\nOverride\naes(y = Level)\naes(x = MMWRweek, y = Level)\n\n\nRemove\naes(y = NULL)\naes(x = MMWRweek)\n\n\n\nIt is therefore best practice to assign the Data or Mapping in the leading ggplot() plot object when you want those settings carried forward to all subsequent layers. When you need to specify new settings for select Geometric or Statistic layers, then you can specify those mappings in that layer, overriding any previous designation. You can find more information about plot object layering in ggplot in Chapter 13 Build a plot layer by layer in ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nThe ability to treat each layer as its own object in the coding environment allows for flexible and adaptive programming. For example, you can predefined the settings to generating a smoothed line that you apply to different ggplot() objects, leaning on inherited Data and/or aesthetics Mappings given in each.\nYou can find more information about plot object layering in ggplot in Chapter 18 Programming with ggplot2 in ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.\n\n\nTo exhibit this in our running example, let’s add our pièce de résistance, the cherry on top, a leading point highlighting the most recently recorded surveillance week. In order to isolate this exact point, we need to prepare a different subset from the same dataset. We do this by filtering for the same distinguishing variables (Region, Season, and Characteristic Level), followed by filtering to the current infections season, and then finally the most recent week recorded.\nThis point is added to our graph as a fresh layer that is printed on the plot object generated up to the geom_line() expression. In the function settings, we override the inherited Data object and leave the Mappings blank, allowing the aesthetics settings to be inherited from the ggplot() object.\n\n# Subset the dataset to isolate the leading data point we wish to plot.\nleading_point = df |&gt; \n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level %in% ages_ordered) |&gt;\n  filter(MMWRyear == max(MMWRyear)) |&gt;\n  filter(MMWRweek == max(MMWRweek))\n\n# Add a new Geometry layer, geom_point(), using a new dataset.\ndf |&gt;\n  filter(Region == \"Connecticut\", Season %in% include_seasons, Level %in% ages_ordered) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = MMWRweek, y = Kernel, color = Season) ) +\n    geom_line() +  \n    # Show the leading point as a red dot using the leading_point subset.\n    geom_point(data = leading_point, color = \"red\") +\n    labs(title = \"RSV Infection Trends Since 2022\",\n         x = \"Weeks Since July\", \n         y = \"Positive RSV Tests\\n(scaled and kernel smoothed)\") +\n    ylim(0, 100) +\n    scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\", palette = \"Dark2\") +\n    facet_grid(~factor(Level, levels = ages_ordered)) + \n    theme_linedraw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at us, we are such ggplot experts now!

These are topics well worth their own workshop, and I will not have time to do them justice here.\nThe goal of the next two sections will be to introduce you to these rich topics. At the end of this section, you will hopefully find these topics more approachable and are better equip to use them in your own work.\n\n4.3.1 Introduction to Map Projections with ggoplot\nCanonically, map projections are interpreting the curved surface of the earth into a flat plane. For our purposes, we need to render the polygons that represent this projection and associate them with metadata that will visualization our data. ggplot2 comes with two different methods to do both these steps: geom_polygon() or geom_sf().\nThe first is not as robust as the second and, in fact, the second method is recommended by the ggplot2 developers over geom_polygon() for this reason. We are therefore only going to cover geom_sf().\nBefore we apply this function, let’s think first about what we are doing. Previously I mentioned that map projections are interpreting a curved shape into a flat plane. This projection will give us boundary points that are plotable on a linear Cartesian plane, called polygons. “Simple features”, from which we get “sf”, are standard vector data produced by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) that interpret this action into plotable polygons.\nUnfortunately, getting a file that contains the region boundaries we are looking for is a rather, shall we say, winding task. This problem gets compounded if we need our resource to contain granular information about the region, such as rivers, lakes, and topology, or even man-made infrastructure, such as roads, cities, or census boundaries.\nWe’re not going to bother with this problem for now. Our dataset contains information about select contiguous U.S. states, and batches those trends into the HHS regions. Even though we do not need to be immediately concerned with how to plot Alaska and Hawaii into the same figure, we will include that as well.\nHere, we will reference the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing, or TIGER/Line Shapefiles, provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. The R package tigris allows us to pull these files from the U.S. Census Bureau website and process them for our application.\n\n# Call the TIGER/Line Shapefiles from the Census Bureau.\nus_geo &lt;- tigris::states(class = \"sf\", cb = TRUE) |&gt;\n  # Translate the geometric locations for Alaska and Hawaii to plot underneath\n  # the contiguous states.\n  shift_geometry()\n\nhead(us_geo)\n\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 6 features and 9 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -2356114 ymin: -782290.7 xmax: 1419556 ymax: 970427.9\nProjected CRS: USA_Contiguous_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic\n  STATEFP  STATENS     GEOIDFQ GEOID STUSPS         NAME LSAD        ALAND\n1      35 00897535 0400000US35    35     NM   New Mexico   00 314198519809\n2      46 01785534 0400000US46    46     SD South Dakota   00 196341670967\n3      06 01779778 0400000US06    06     CA   California   00 403673433805\n4      21 01779786 0400000US21    21     KY     Kentucky   00 102266755818\n5      01 01779775 0400000US01    01     AL      Alabama   00 131185561946\n6      13 01705317 0400000US13    13     GA      Georgia   00 149485762701\n       AWATER                       geometry\n1   726531289 MULTIPOLYGON (((-1231344 -5...\n2  3387563375 MULTIPOLYGON (((-633765.6 8...\n3 20291632828 MULTIPOLYGON (((-2066923 -2...\n4  2384136185 MULTIPOLYGON (((584560 -886...\n5  4581813708 MULTIPOLYGON (((760323.7 -7...\n6  4419221858 MULTIPOLYGON (((1390722 -58...\n\n\nIn this dataset, we see that there are various state identifiers\n\nSTATEFP - Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) ID\nSTATENS - United States Geological Survey (USGS) ID\nAFFGEOID - American Fact Finder Geographic Identifiers\nGEOID - the standard geographic identifiers\n\nand land type identifiers\n\nLSAD - Legal/Statistical Area Description (LSAD)\nALAND - land size in square miles\nAWATER - water size in square miles\nGeometry - the longitude and latitude for the polygon vertices.\n\nTogether, these are used by geom_sf() to create map projections out of our spacial data. And believe it or not, that was the hardest part about map projections. Once we have these polygons, we are well on our way to visualizing our data on a map.\nGoing back to our running example, let’s show the distribution of infection trends near the peak of the 2024-25 season, around weeks 24 to 26.\n\nsubset &lt;- df |&gt;\n  # Keep only the states and the timeframe we want to plot.\n  filter(Region %in% c(datasets::state.name, \"District of Columbia\"),\n         Season %in% \"2024-25\", MMWRweek %in% c(24:26))\n\n# Combine the two datasets by Region in df and NAME in us_geo.\ngeo_df &lt;- us_geo |&gt; \n  left_join(subset, c(\"NAME\" = \"Region\")) |&gt;\n  # Using GEOID, we will only keep the U.S. states.\n  filter(GEOID &lt; 60)\n\nmap_plot &lt;- geo_df |&gt;\n  # Color the polygon with the number of RSV positives tested.\n  ggplot(aes(fill = Kernel), color = \"black\") +\n    # Apply the SF compatible Geometry.\n    geom_sf() +\n    # Scale the aesthetics to apply the viridis colors and do not\n    # add colors for the NA's\n    scale_fill_viridis(direction = -1, na.value = \"grey92\") +\n    labs(fill = NULL, title = \"Peak 2024-25 Season RSV Infection Trends\\nResults Scaled and Gaussian Kernel Smoothed\") +\n    # Apply the SF compatible Coordinates.\n    coord_sf() +\n    theme_map()\n\nmap_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVoilà!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeometry and Statistic Layers Dictate the Aesthetics Mapping\n\n\n\nggplot is a convenient way to render a plot, but it is not the most efficient package option out there! If you are looking for something that is faster and more flexible, you might want to check out packages like leaflet (Cran R documentation).\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Introduction to Interactive Plotting with plotly\nA static graphic can communicate a lot about your data, but with html widgets, like plotly, you can make the plot user interactive. These widgets allow actions like zooming, hovering, and selecting variables in the legend to be displayed. There are different widgets to choose from, and usually you will pick one that is best suited to make the graphic you intend. You can find some inspiration from the R Graph Gallery.\nToday, I will show you how to apply one of the most commonly used interactive packages, plotly. This package is cross platform compatible and can be used in Python, Julia, and MATLAB. It has its own standalone function for plot generation that come with more options, but if you are looking to quickly make a ggplot() interactive all you need to do is wrap it with ggplotly().\nYou can find more about plotly and the kinds of interactive plots it can generate with ggplot() objections in their documentation: Plotly R Open Source Graphing Library and Plotly ggplot2 Open Source Graphing Library.\n\nggplotly(map_plot)",

In this questions, we want to focus on the third one, Region. Using the final line-graph code from the worked through example, add a row-wise facet to compare two states or HHS regions.\nIn the polished version of the line plot we layered an additional point on the graph that highlighted the most currently represented date in the active infection season. To get this data, we externally filtered down the dataset to give that point, repeating some of the filtering we are already doing before the plot gets generated.\n\nCan you modify this approach so that we no longer require the external dataset, thus simplifying our code?\nNow try using stat_summary(filtered_data, geom = \"point\", fun = \"max\", color = \"red\") instead of geom_point(). If you only filter to MMWRyear, do you get the same result, and if not why?\n\nIn our line graph we faceted by age groups. But we see that if we apply a simple Facet layer to our map plot the NA values get plotted in their own panel.\n\nWhy is this happening?\nFix this code to prevent this panel from being generated.",
