## Description: This script harmonizes U.S. census year data and intercensal
##              year population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. Two 
##              methods are reflected: the Official U.S. Projections (OE) and 
##              International Database (IDB). Total U.S. population and the
##              population of Puerto Rico are present in both. Refer to the
##              "Population Estimates and Projections for the U.S. Island Areas"
##              webpage for additional details about when to use which source.
##              Pertinent links and other details about the data can be found 
##              in the README for this projects GitHub repository subdirectory,
##              folder "Population Estimates and Projections".

## LOAD IN THE DATA

## The COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and 
## Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University used census data compiled
## by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It spans 2010 to 2018, and the data
## ultimately comes from the U.S. Census Bureau annual vintage release for 2018.
## 
## Here we harmonized three data sets from the U.S. Census Bureau: U.S. States
## and Puerto Rico counts for the 2010 to 2019 vintage, the 2020 to 2023
## vintage, and IDB population estimates and projections for U.S. territories
## from 2010 to 2023. The U.S. Department of Agriculture data is ported in only
## to supplement for missing 2020 Census year counts from the 2020 to 2023
## vintage. Further details about the data can be found in the README 
## file for this projects GitHub repository subdirectory.

census_2010to2019_raw <- read_csv(
  "Git-and-GitHub/Data/Population Estimates and Projections/U.S. Census Bureau_2010 to 2019 State Population Estimates_All Components_Downloaded 10.25.2024.csv",
) |> as.data.frame()

census_2020to2023_raw <- read_csv(

## HARMONIZE THE DATASETS

dim(census_2010to2019_raw)
dim(census_2020to2023_raw)
dim(census_idb_2010to2023_raw)

## We see these data sets have different row and column dimensions. This is to
## be expected, as they span different date ranges. The IDB data is also in a
## long format and not a wide format, like the other sources. The API to
## compile the IDB did not offer all of the same variables as the other ones,
## but there may be opportunities to calculate some of these values with
## the available variables.
## 
## Therefore, we will need to do some data transformations to get them into one 
## standardized format. First we will add the missing 2020 Census year counts
## to our census_2020to2023_raw file.




## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## SUPPLEMENT THE MISSING 2020 CENSUS YEAR COUNTS

## census_2020to2023_raw is missing the 2020 Census values. This can be
## supplemented using the U.S. Department of Agriculture's compilation of
## the same U.S. Census Bureau data. This source has census counts represented
## down to the county-level.

# Read in alternative source for the 2020 Census data
census_2020to2023_depAg_raw <- read_excel(
  "Git-and-GitHub/Data/Population Estimates and Projections/U.S. Department of Agriculture_Population Estimates 2020 to 2023_Downloaded 10.18.2024.xlsx",
  skip = 4
) |> as.data.frame()


## Now we'll extract out the specific column and row entries to supplement the
## missing 2020 Census, observed counts in census_2020to2023_raw.

# State/territory and U.S. regions included in census_2020to2023_raw. This is
# our search space from the supplementary information
search_space = census_2020to2023_raw$NAME

# Retrieve the 2020 Census counts.

  distinct() |>
  `colnames<-`(c("NAME", "CENSUS2020POP"))


## We have our census data, but the target search space includes sums over
## different regional and divisional groupings of U.S. states. Using the
## regional map from the U.S. Census Bureau, we can calculate these sums.

## REFORMAT THE IDB RAW DATA SET

## Referring to the 2020 to 2023 methods, we see that:
##    - Domestic immigration measures movement of people within U.S. states. 
##    - Net migration requires information about the number of people who enter 
##      the country and the number who leave. 
##    - When using the Official U.S. Projections method, the residual measures 
##      deviation between the balancing equation and the final estimates. The 
##      balancing equation is used to make estimates consistent across
##      different geographic locations and demographic characteristics.
##    - Base population estimates are the starting point for vintage
##      population estimations.
##
## We cannot back-calculate any of these variables using the information 
## available from the IDB API, leaving "NPOPCHG". This is simply calculated by
## taking the difference between projected population estimates for the i+1
## and ith year. In the 2010 to 2019 and 2020 to 2023 data sets, the first 
## entry under 2010 and 2020, respectively, shows the difference between the 
## census year population estimate and base estimate. We will set these
## positions to NA here, as the population estimates for 2010 and 2020 were
## not available from the IDB API.

## Recall that "RDOMESTICMIG" is not reported for the census year. Considering
## this, we see that all entries associated with "DOMESTICMIG", "RDOMESTICMIG",
## and "RESIDUAL" for the United States and Puerto Rico only. Because the
## column-wise search was for any occurrence, we will confirm that each

## Looks like they indeed are. It makes sense that the "DOMESTICMIG" and
## "RDOMESTICMIG" are actually NA's instead of zeros, as represent migration
## between U.S. states. As stated previously, "RESIDUAL" represents the
## deviation between the balancing equation and the final estimates. This is
## done to make estimates consistent across different geographic locations and 
## demographic characteristics. As with the domestic migration metric, a
## balancing equation is likely not applied to the United States or Puerto
## Rico, as they are not parsed representations of a larger area, like the 
## U.S. states. Therefore, we'll set these entries to NA instead of zero.

census_2010to2019_raw[census_2010to2019_raw$NAME %in% c("United States", "Puerto Rico" ), zeros_2010to2019] <- NA

## with the row entries.
## 
## Recall that above we found the number of rows differed between the 2010 to
## 2019 and the 2020 to 2023 raw formats. One likely source of this difference
## could be one set calculates over specific regions in addition to the
## state-level counts. Another could be duplicated entries.

us_regions = c("United States", sort(c(datasets::state.name, "District of Columbia")) )

# Find the non-state and Puerto Rico entries.

## We see that the 2010 to 2019 data set is missing entries calculating sums
## over specific division of the U.S., but all of the regional counts are
## included. We will therefore supplement row-entries for sums over the
## divisions in the 2010 to 2019 intercensal year estimates.

# Recall
us_regions_divisions

# Remove the regions that are not represented in the us_regions_divisions
# reference table.

  census_2010to2019_raw,

## Now that the row-entries are resolved, we can proceed with mixing in

## From these results, we see that most column names are the same between

## column names to adhere to the "...INC" format.
