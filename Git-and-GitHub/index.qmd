# Getting Started with Git and GitHub {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Git and GitHub are two of the most popular and often utilized development tools for project version control on the market. Regarless of their status, they remain challenging tools for new users to get started with. Many resources cover siloed or non-generalizable topics about one or the other. Few resources offer a one-stop-shop introduction that quickly takes users through initial set-up and through basic use cases with individual or collaborative projects.

In this workshop, we aim to merge the worlds of Git and GitHub in an approachable but comprehensive format that is accessible to people who have never used Git or GitHub before or those interested in improving their existing workflows. Maybe you are like I was, flying blind using the bare minimum of what Git and GitHub has to offer!

Over the course of the workshop chapter, we will take you through:

* Git and GitHub account set-up with configurations by either SSH keys or HTTPS urls.
* Detailed walk through the standard Git version control workflow and interactions with the remote repository stored in GitHub.
* Another detailed walk through collaborating on projects with a team through GitHub.

Real-world examples with questions/answers and challenge questions/solutions are provided for:

* Adding a local, Git initiated, project to GitHub for the first time.
* Cloning an existing repository as a "clean-break" copy for the first time.
* Collaborations with a shared GitHub repository (invite friends to have the full experience!)


## Get Your Configurations

In order to participate in the entire workshop, you will need to have:

- Git installed locally and configured with a user and email.
- GitHub account.
- A Git and GitHub transfer protocol configured and linked. Either SSH key or HTML url is acceptable, but we recommend using SSH key.

Please watch the following video to learn how you can get set up. Soon, we will release a webpage that covers the same steps.

### Codespaces

In this workshop you will need to access the R code we have prepared for the worked through example and challenge questions. If you have not already, you will need to download [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) to your local device, and we suggest using the integrated development environment (IDE) software [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Accessing the code for this workshop requires that you have git installed on your local device, a GitHub account, and you have configured the two. If you have not done this, go through [Accounts and Configurations](git-github-setup.html) first.

::: {.callout-important collapse="true"}
This workshop was generated using R (v 4.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v 2024.12.1+563). `renv()` is included to reproduce the same coding enviroment, storing all the relevant packages and package versions needed in the code. If you experience trouble running the scripts, you might want to check that the environment was initialized and that you are using the same version of R and RStudio.
:::

Two GitHub repositories have been created to practice using git and GitHub:

-  Solo projects: [ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Vaccinations](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Vaccinations)
-  Group projects: [ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/JHU-CRC-Cases-and-Deaths)

In order to practice your skills with git and GitHub using our codespaces, you will need to create a "clean-break" copy of both repositories. This will fully decouple the codespace connections from the ysph-dsde GitHub accout, and allow you full access to its contents. After you have copied the repository to your personal GitHub, you will need to clone the codespace to your local device and initialize the environment.

Below we have detailed how to do all three steps. Notice that there are two methods to do this: by the [GitHub Importer](#method-1-copying-using-github-importer) tool or your [command-line application](#method-2-copying-using-the-command-line-application) (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows). We suggest you attempt the "GitHub Importer" tool option first, and if that fails to follow the command-line steps. Please note that the importer tool will sometimes take a few minutes to fully transfer over the files.


### Making a Clean-Break Copy

#### METHOD 1: Copying Using GitHub Importer

::: {.callout-note}
This method is not a Fork. You can learn more about GitHub Importer [here](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-github-importer/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer).
:::

1. [Log in](https://github.com/login) to your personal GitHub account.

2. In the top-right of the page navigation bar, select the [ {{< iconify octicon:plus-16 >}} {{< iconify octicon:triangle-down-24 >}} ]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #010409; color: #b8bbbf; border: 1px solid #9198a1; padding: 3px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"} dropdown menu and click [ {{< iconify octicon:repo-push-24 >}} Import repository]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #010409; color: #b8bbbf; border: 1px solid #9198a1; padding: 3px; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-radius: 5px;"}.


3. Fill out the following sections:

    a. **Your source repository details:** Paste the https url of the repositories listed above. No credentials are required for this action.

    b. **Your new repository details:** Adjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository. It is good practice to initially set the repository to "Private".

4. Click the [ Begin import ]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #1f6feb; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #0d1117; padding: 3px; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-radius: 5px;"} button to copy the codespace.

5. After a few minutes, the newly created GitHub repository webpage will open up.

If this method is successful, then proceed to the [Cloning the Copied Repository](#cloning-the-copied-repository) section. If this is not successful, you can try using the command-line application menthod detailed in [Method 2](#method-2-copying-using-the-command-line-application).

#### METHOD 2: Copying Using The Command-Line Application

These directions follow GitHub's [duplicating a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/duplicating-a-repository) page.

1. [Log in](https://github.com/login) to your personal GitHub account.

2. Navigate to the ysph-dsde GitHub repository you want to copy by either searching for it by name or opening the url provided above.

3. Near the right side of the page there will be a [ {{< iconify octicon:code-16 >}} \ Begin import {{< iconify octicon:triangle-down-24 >}} ]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #1f6feb; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #0d1117; padding: 3px; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-radius: 5px;"} button to click. In its drop down menu under the "Local" tab you will see options to copy the SSH key or HTTPS url to the repository. 

    For example, if the repository name is "ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY" they will look like:

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    # SSH
    git@github.com:ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git

    # HTTPS
    https://github.com/ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git
    ```
    
    Depending on your Git/GitHub configurations, you will copy one of these for the remainder of the steps.
    
:::{.callout-important style="margin-left: 2rem"}
SSH keys or HTTPS urls are file transfer protocols that are used to pass information between your local git configured directory to the remote GitHub repository. Only one protocol can be set up for one Git/GitHub connection.
:::
   
4. Open the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) and navigate to the file location you want to temporarily store the repository copy.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    cd "/file_location/"
    ```

5. Clone a bare copy of the original repository using its SSH key or HTTPS url:

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    # SSH
    git clone --bare git@github.com:ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git

    # HTTPS
    git clone --bare https://github.com/ysph-dsde/ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git
    ```
   
6. Open the project file.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    cd "ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git"
    ```
    
7. Back in GitHub, in the top-right of the page navigation bar select the [ {{< iconify octicon:plus-16 >}} {{< iconify octicon:triangle-down-24 >}} ]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #010409; color: #b8bbbf; border: 1px solid #9198a1; padding: 3px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-radius: 5px;"} dropdown menu and click [ {{< iconify octicon:repo-24 >}} New repository]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #010409; color: #b8bbbf; border: 1px solid #9198a1; padding: 3px; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-radius: 5px;"}.

8. Fill out the following sections:

    a. Adjust the GitHub account owner as needed and create the name for the new repository.
    
    c. It is good practice to initially set the repository to "Private".
    
    d. Do **[NOT]{.underline}** use a template or include a description, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, or license.
    
9. In the newly created GitHub repository under "Quick setup" you will find the repository's SSH key or HTTPS url. Copy this.
   
10. Back in the command-line application, push a mirror of the cloned git file to your newly created GitHub repository using its SSH key or HTPPS url:

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    # SSH
    git push --mirror git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
    
    # HTTPS
    git push --mirror https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
    ```
    
    Refresh the new GitHub reposiotry webpage to confirm the push was successful.

11. Delete the bare cloned file used to create a new remote repository.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    cd ..                                   # Go back one file location
    rm -rf ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY.git          # Delete the bare clone
    ```
    
12. This completes creating a clean-break copy of the ysph-dsde repository codespace. Proceed with cloning the newly made repository to your local device in the following section.

### Cloning the Copied Repository

Now that you have copied this repository into your own GitHub, you are ready to proceed with a standard clone to your local device.
  
1. Copy the SSH key or HTTPS url to the newly created repository in your GitHub account by finding the codes under the [ {{< iconify octicon:code-16 >}} \ Begin import {{< iconify octicon:triangle-down-24 >}} ]{style="white-space: nowrap; background-color: #1f6feb; color: #ffffff; border: 1px solid #0d1117; padding: 3px; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; border-radius: 5px;"} button. 

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    # SSH
    git@github.com:ysph-dsde/NEW-REPOSITORY.git

    # HTTPS
    https://github.com/ysph-dsde/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
    ```
  
2. In the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) navigate to the file location you want to store the repository.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    cd "/file_location/"
    ```
   
3. Clone the the repository.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    # using SSH
    git clone git@github.com:EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git

    # or using HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/EXAMPLE-USER/NEW-REPOSITORY.git
    ```

4. **OPTIONAL:** You can reset the repository history, which will clear the previous commits, by running the following block of code (Source: [StackExchange by Zeelot](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9683279/make-the-current-commit-the-only-initial-commit-in-a-git-repository)).
    
    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    git checkout --orphan tempBranch         # Create a temporary branch
    git add -A                               # Add all files and commit them
    git commit -m "Reset the repo"
    git branch -D main                       # Deletes the main branch
    git branch -m main                       # Rename the current branch to main
    git push -f origin main                  # Force push main branch to GitHub
    git gc --aggressive --prune=all          # Remove the old files
    ```

### Initializing the Environment

After cloning the codespace to your local device, you will need to initialize the environment using `renv()`. This will install all packages and versions used in the workshop, thus creating a reproducible coding environemnt.

1. In the command-line application (i.e. Terminal for Macs and Windows Terminal for windows) navigate to the file location you want to store the repository.

    ```{.bash filename="Command-Line Application"}
    cd "/file_location/"
    ```

2. Launch the project by opening the `*.Rproj` in RStudio.

4. In the R console, activate the enviroment by runing the following lines of code:

    ```{.r filename="RStudio Console"}
    renv::init()          # Initialize the project
    renv::restore()       # Download packages and their version saved in the lockfile.
    ```

:::{.callout-note style="margin-left: 2rem"}
If you are asked to update packages, say no. The `renv()` is intended to recreate the same environment under which the project was created, making it reproducible. You are ready to proceed when running `renv::restore()` gives the output:

```{.r filename="RStudio Output"}
- The library is already synchronized with the lockfile.
```

If you experience any trouble with this step, you might want to confirm that you are using  R (v 4.4.3) in the RStudio IDE (v 2024.12.1+563). You can also read more about `renv()` in their [vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

## About the Data

The [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/) (JHU CRC) tracked and compiled global COVID-19 pandemic data from January 22, 2020 and March 10, 2023. These data are publically available through their two GitHub repositories. We imported two datasets for this workshop content:

- Cumulative vaccination counts for the U.S. from their [GovEX/COVID-19](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data) GitHub repository. The raw data used in the analysis script can be found in the `data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series` subdirectory ([original source](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/blob/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data/time_series/time_series_covid19_vaccine_us.csv)).
- Cumulative case and death counts for the U.S. from their [CSSE GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). The raw data for these two datasets used in the analysis can be found in the `csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series` subdirectory ([original source](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series)). Both `time_series_covid19_confirmed_US.csv` and `time_series_covid19_deaths_US.csv` were used.

The data dictionaries provided by JHU CRC can be found here: [Vaccinations Dataset Data Dictionary](https://github.com/govex/COVID-19/tree/master/data_tables/vaccine_data/us_data) and [Cases and Deaths Datasets Data Dictionary](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data#usa-daily-state-reports-csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us). For our purposes, we conducted some data cleaning, harmonization, and smoothing using an isotonic regression. This included harmonizing the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 to 2019 population projections with 2020 to 2023 vintages. 

Details about these steps can be found in the `Git-and-GitHub/R` directory of this workshop's GitHub repository ([link to code](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/Book-of-Workshops/tree/main/Git-and-GitHub/R)). The cleaned datasets used in this workshop can be found in the `Git-and-GitHub/Data` directory of this workshop's GitHub repository ([link to data](https://github.com/ysph-dsde/Book-of-Workshops/tree/main/Git-and-GitHub/Data)).
